            1. What are the main differences between external, internal, and
            inline CSS?
          </h3>
          <p>
            These are 3 ways of inserting a style sheet,
            <li>
              External style sheet; you have to link the external stylesheet to
              the html
            </li>
            <li>
              The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the
              head section
            </li>
            <li>
              An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single
              element. You have to add the style attribute to the relevant
              element.
            </li>
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>2. What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?</h3>
          <p>
            the syntax for class is class="nameOfClass" and for ID is
            id="nameOfId"
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            3. How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
          </h3>
          <p>i would use descendant combinator</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            4. Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary,
            how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
          </h3>
          <p>#title { atributes } .primary { atributes }</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>5. What does the descendant combinator do?</h3>
          <p>
            The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of
            a specified element.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>
            6. Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses
            three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
          </h3>
          <p>the first rule written</p>
        </div>

            7. From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model
            properties?
          </h3>
          <p>1 content 2 padding 3 border 4 margin</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>8. What does the box-sizing CSS property do?</h3>
          <p>
            allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total
            width and height.
          </p>
        </div>

            9. What is the difference between the standard and alternative box
            model?
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is
            added to the width and height of the box. If you are using the
            alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content
            box smaller as it takes up some of that available width and height .

            10. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2
            elements?
          </h3>
          <p>margin</p>

            11. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the
            contents of an element and its border?
          </h3>
          <p>padding</p>

            12. Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to
            overlap each other?
          </h3>
          <p>padding</p>

            13. What is the difference between a block element and an inline
            element?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers
            automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the
            element. An inline element does not start on a new line.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            14. What is the difference between an inline element and an
            inline-block element?
          </h3>
          <p>
            inline The element doesn’t start on a new line and only occupy just
            the width it requires. You can’t set the width or height.
            inline-block It’s formatted just like the inline element, where it
            doesn’t start on a new line. BUT, you can set width and height
            values.

          <h3>
            19. What’s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A flex container expands items to fill available free space or
            shrinks them to prevent overflow and Flexbox items are the immediate
            children in a flex container
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>20. How do you create a flex item?</h3>
          <p>
            You have to give the atribute display: flex, to the father element
            of the flex item you want to display
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>

            21. What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property?

            22. How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead
            of horizontally?

          <p>display: flex; flex-direction: column;</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            23. What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?
          </h3>
          <p>
            justify-content — controls alignment of all items on the main axis.
            align-items — controls alignment of all items on the cross axis
          </p>

          <h3>
            24. How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex
            container?
          </h3>
          <p>align-items: center; justify-content: center;</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>
            25. What’s the difference between justify-content: space-between and
            justify-content: space-around?
          </h3>
          <p>
            justify-content: space-between -> items are evenly distributed in
            the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
            justify-content: space-around -> items are evenly distributed in the
            line with equal space around them
